# Voise Assistant
Welcome to this project on creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. This voice assistant is a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user.

In this repository I have listed only 'core' files discribing main functionality behind assistant.
